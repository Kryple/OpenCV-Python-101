A histogram in image processing is a graphical representation of the distribution of pixel intensities in an image. It shows how many pixels in the image have a particular intensity value.  
Key points about histograms:
- X-axis: Represents the pixel intensity values (usually ranging from 0 to 255 for 8-bit grayscale images). 
- Y-axis: Represents the number of pixels with a corresponding intensity value. 
- Shape: The shape of the histogram provides insights into the image's contrast, brightness, and dynamic range.
